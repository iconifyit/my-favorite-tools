## JavaScript

The majority of my coding these days is JavaScript including React, NodeJS, 
JavaScript Extension (Adobe CEP extensions), etc. But I have extensive experience with Python,
PHP, Java, Bash, and AppleScript. I have a tiny bit of C++ experience (enough to cause harm).
Learning programming languages is very much like learning spoken languages. After your thrid 
one, it becomes infinitely easier to learn new ones. Your brain just becomes wired differently 
to understand languages more abstractly.
